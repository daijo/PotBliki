Officially Supported Extensions
-------------------------------

These extensions are included with (at least) the most recent release and are 
officially supported by the Python-Markdown developers. Any documentation is 
maintained here and all bug reports should be made to the project. If you 
have a typical install of Python-Markdown, these extensions are already 
available to you.
